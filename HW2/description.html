The project is an implementation of a pretrained Stable Diffusion 1.5 model.
The model denoises Gaussian noise into a coherent image for a set number of steps.
At each step, the model predicts the noise of the current latent representation based on both the conditional (prompt) embedding and the unconditional embedding.
These predictions are combined using the CFG to bias the denoising toward the prompt.
The latent values are then updated, removing noise from the image.
After the final step, the latent representation is decoded by VAE, producing an image.
