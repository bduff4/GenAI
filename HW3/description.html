The project is a simple chat bot using LangChain and Gemini. 
It starts by loading a Google API key previously set up by the user.
Next, one of various models is loaded with a temperature of 0.1 to ensure deterministic responses.
The persona of the bot is then set with SystemMessage, also initializing the history.
The bot then enters a interaction loop, where the user is prompted for an input.
Each prompt is added to the history, which is sent to the model to generate a response.
The output is extracted as plain text, printed, and then appended to the conversation history.
This repeats until the user terminates the loop.
